It is now well established that most of the adult users of tobacco start tobacco use in childhood or adolescence. There has been a perceptible fall in smoking in developed countries after the realization of the harmful effects of tobacco. The tobacco companies are now aggressively targeting their advertising strategies in developing countries like India. Understanding the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use in specific demographics, such as school-going children aged 13-15, is crucial for implementing targeted interventions and prevention strategies. The GYTS-4 is a robust survey designed to produce national estimates, providing valuable data on various aspects of tobacco use among school-going children.\nSmoking in teens is a growing concern for several reasons, reflecting the potential short-term and long-term health, social, and economic consequences, like: 1. Health Risks: Adolescents who smoke are exposed to the same health risks as adults, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and various cancers.\n\nAddiction and Nicotine Dependence: Teens are more vulnerable to developing nicotine dependence than adults as the adolescent brain is still developing, and exposure to nicotine during this critical period can lead to addiction, making it harder for individuals to quit smoking later in life.\nEarly Initiation Leads to Lifelong Habits: Research indicates that individuals who start smoking during adolescence are more likely to continue smoking into adulthood.\nImpact on Academic Performance: Smoking can negatively impact academic performance. Nicotine can affect concentration, memory, and cognitive function, potentially hindering a teen’s ability to succeed in school.\nSocial and Behavioral Consequences: Smoking may lead to isolation, strained relationships with non-smoking peers, and engagement in risky behaviors. Additionally, smoking is often associated with other substance use.\n\nTo address these concerns, comprehensive and evidence-based tobacco control strategies, including education, prevention programs, and policy measures, are crucial to reduce the prevalence of smoking among teenagers and protect their long-term health and well-being. We are attempting to figure out trends among teens currently smoking in each state, segregated by rural and urban areas, and assess how these trends are affected by exposure to tobacco smoke at home and in public places. Additionally, we aim to understand the impact of advertisements, warning labels, promotions, bans, and awareness programs initiated by their schools.\nSome questions that we plan to answer after our exploratory analysis and visualizations are: 1. How do tobacco use rates (both ever use and current use) vary among states and between urban and rural areas in India? 2. How easily can young individuals access tobacco products through stores and paan shops in different states across India? 3. How effective are anti-tobacco messages and policies in mitigating tobacco use among the youth in India? 4. To what extent are tobacco control policies (COTPA) implemented and adhered to in schools across various states in India? 5. Do states with more robust implementation of policies regarding tobacco-free schools experience lower rates of tobacco use among students? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ef2817303bc4be932b694cdbb3c682b0d68634c7"
